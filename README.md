SOLID OOD principles in Python

SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles that can help you write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code based on well-designed, cleanly structured classes.

1. Single-responsibility principle (SRP)
2. Openâ€“closed principle (OCP)
3. Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
4. Interface segregation principle (ISP)
5. Dependency inversion principle (DIP)

## Run

- Setup:

```bash
make setup
```

- Run:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
cd SRP
python -u xxx.py
```
